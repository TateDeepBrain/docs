# Unity 3D 캐릭터

:::caution

This part is under construction.
You'll be able to see it soon.

:::

3D Character is implemented in AI Human. Basically, it provides the same UI with AIPlayerDemo's and you can test it. The activity should use different process. (Check out the AndroidManifest.xml's activity settings.)

You can change to other 3d models and it can speak with gestures.
