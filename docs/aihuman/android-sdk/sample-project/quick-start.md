# AI Human QuickStart

- AILiveQuickStart.java

:::

AIHuman Quick Start automatically sets up AIPlayer with the default AI, and the AI will say "Nice to meet you" when loading is complete. There is a default loading time if you are  running this for the first time, so it may take several minutes until it actually speaks depending on the network conditions. After the first utterance (Nice to meet you), the user can press the input box at the bottom of the screen to actually input a sentence to make the AI speak. (This default AI can only process English without setting custom voice.)
